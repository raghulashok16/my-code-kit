In Bootstrap 5, floating labels are used to enhance form inputs by allowing labels to float above the input fields when they are focused or contain a value. Here are the classes used with floating labels in Bootstrap 5:

1. **`.form-floating`**
   - This class is used to wrap the input and label elements to enable floating labels.

2. **`.form-control`**
   - This class is applied to the input element (e.g., `<input>`, `<textarea>`) to style it as a Bootstrap form control.

3. **`.form-select`**
   - This class is used for select elements within a floating label to style dropdown menus.

 # ------------------------------ Example Usage: ------------------------------ #

Here is an example of how these classes are used together to create a floating label form input:

html:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<div class="form-floating mb-3">
  <input type="email" class="form-control" id="floatingInput" placeholder="name@example.com">
  <label for="floatingInput">Email address</label>
</div>

<div class="form-floating">
  <select class="form-select" id="floatingSelect" aria-label="Floating label select example">
    <option selected>Open this select menu</option>
    <option value="1">One</option>
    <option value="2">Two</option>
    <option value="3">Three</option>
  </select>
  <label for="floatingSelect">Works with selects</label>
</div>
