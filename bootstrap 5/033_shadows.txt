In Bootstrap 5, the shadow utility classes allow you to add box shadows to elements. Here is a list of the available shadow classes:

1. No shadow:
   - `shadow-none` - Removes any existing shadow from the element.

2. Small shadow:
   - `shadow-sm` - Adds a small shadow to the element.

3. Regular shadow:
   - `shadow` - Adds a regular shadow to the element.

4. Large shadow:
   - `shadow-lg` - Adds a larger shadow to the element.

These classes can be applied to any HTML element to control its shadow. For example:

html:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<div class="shadow-none">
  This div has no shadow.
</div>

<div class="shadow-sm">
  This div has a small shadow.
</div>

<div class="shadow">
  This div has a regular shadow.
</div>

<div class="shadow-lg">
  This div has a large shadow.
</div>
