In Bootstrap 5, container classes are used to provide a responsive fixed-width or fluid-width container for layout purposes. These containers are a fundamental part of Bootstrap's grid system. Below is a list of all the container classes available in Bootstrap 5, along with a brief description of each:

 1. `.container`
- Description: Provides a responsive fixed-width container.
- Behavior: The width of the container changes at each responsive breakpoint.

 2. `.container-sm`
- Description: Provides a responsive fixed-width container that is 100% wide until the `sm` breakpoint.
- Behavior: The container is full-width until the `sm` breakpoint, after which it has a fixed width.

 3. `.container-md`
- Description: Provides a responsive fixed-width container that is 100% wide until the `md` breakpoint.
- Behavior: The container is full-width until the `md` breakpoint, after which it has a fixed width.

 4. `.container-lg`
- Description: Provides a responsive fixed-width container that is 100% wide until the `lg` breakpoint.
- Behavior: The container is full-width until the `lg` breakpoint, after which it has a fixed width.

 5. `.container-xl`
- Description: Provides a responsive fixed-width container that is 100% wide until the `xl` breakpoint.
- Behavior: The container is full-width until the `xl` breakpoint, after which it has a fixed width.

 6. `.container-xxl`
- Description: Provides a responsive fixed-width container that is 100% wide until the `xxl` breakpoint.
- Behavior: The container is full-width until the `xxl` breakpoint, after which it has a fixed width.

 7. `.container-fluid`
- Description: Provides a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport.
- Behavior: The container is always full-width, regardless of the viewport size.

<body>
  <div class="container">
    <p>This is a fixed-width container.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container-sm">
    <p>This is a fixed-width container that is full-width until the sm breakpoint.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container-md">
    <p>This is a fixed-width container that is full-width until the md breakpoint.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container-lg">
    <p>This is a fixed-width container that is full-width until the lg breakpoint.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container-xl">
    <p>This is a fixed-width container that is full-width until the xl breakpoint.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container-xxl">
    <p>This is a fixed-width container that is full-width until the xxl breakpoint.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <p>This is a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>

# -------------------------------- Explanation ------------------------------- #

1. `.container`: Creates a responsive fixed-width container with varying widths at different breakpoints.
2. `.container-sm` to `.container-xxl`: Create responsive fixed-width containers that are full-width until their respective breakpoints.
3. `.container-fluid`: Creates a full-width container that always spans the entire width of the viewport, regardless of the screen size.

These container classes are essential for creating responsive layouts using the Bootstrap grid system.
