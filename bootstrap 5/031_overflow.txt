In Bootstrap 5, the overflow utility classes allow you to control the overflow behavior of an element's content. Here is a list of the available overflow classes:

1. `overflow-auto` - Adds scrollbars when needed.
2. `overflow-hidden` - Hides overflow.
3. `overflow-visible` - Default value; content is not clipped and may be rendered outside the element's box.
4. `overflow-scroll` - Adds scrollbars always.

Additionally, you can control overflow behavior for the x and y axes separately:

1. `overflow-x-auto` - Adds horizontal scrollbars when needed.
2. `overflow-x-hidden` - Hides horizontal overflow.
3. `overflow-x-visible` - Default value for horizontal overflow; content is not clipped.
4. `overflow-x-scroll` - Adds horizontal scrollbars always.

5. `overflow-y-auto` - Adds vertical scrollbars when needed.
6. `overflow-y-hidden` - Hides vertical overflow.
7. `overflow-y-visible` - Default value for vertical overflow; content is not clipped.
8. `overflow-y-scroll` - Adds vertical scrollbars always.

These classes can be applied to any HTML element to control its overflow behavior. For example:

html:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<div class="overflow-auto">
  This div will have scrollbars when the content overflows.
</div>
