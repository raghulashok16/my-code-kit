In Bootstrap 5, the opacity utility classes allow you to set the opacity of an element. Here is a list of the available opacity classes:

1. `opacity-0` - Sets the opacity to 0 (fully transparent)
2. `opacity-25` - Sets the opacity to 0.25
3. `opacity-50` - Sets the opacity to 0.50
4. `opacity-75` - Sets the opacity to 0.75
5. `opacity-100` - Sets the opacity to 1 (fully opaque)

These classes can be applied to any HTML element to adjust its opacity. For example:

html:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<div class="opacity-50">
  This div has 50% opacity.
</div>
