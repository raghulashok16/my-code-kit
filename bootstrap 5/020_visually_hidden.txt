In Bootstrap 5, the utility class used to visually hide elements while keeping them accessible to screen readers is `.visually-hidden`. This is particularly useful for accessibility purposes, such as providing additional context to screen reader users without displaying the content on the screen.

# -------- Here are the classes under visually hidden in Bootstrap 5: -------- #

1. `.visually-hidden`
   - Hides an element visually but keeps it accessible to screen readers.

2. `.visually-hidden-focusable`
   - Hides an element visually but makes it visible when focused (useful for skip-to-content links or similar interactive elements).

# ------------------------------- Example Usage ------------------------------ #

Here is an example of how to use these classes in your HTML:

html:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Bootstrap 5 Visually Hidden Classes</title>
    <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/5.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container mt-5">
        <!-- Visually Hidden Element -->
        <p class="visually-hidden">This text is hidden visually but accessible to screen readers.</p>

        <!-- Visually Hidden Focusable Element -->
        <a href="#main-content" class="visually-hidden-focusable">Skip to main content</a>

        <!-- Example Main Content -->
        <div id="main-content" class="mt-5">
            <h1>Main Content</h1>
            <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

 Explanation:

- `.visually-hidden`: The paragraph with this class will not be visible on the screen but will still be accessible to screen readers.
- `.visually-hidden-focusable`: The anchor link with this class will be hidden visually but will become visible when it receives focus (e.g., when navigated to via keyboard).

These classes help maintain accessibility standards while allowing you to control the visibility of elements in your Bootstrap 5 projects.
