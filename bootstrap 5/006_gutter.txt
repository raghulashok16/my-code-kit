1. General Gutter Class: The first row uses the `.g-3` class to set both horizontal and vertical gutter spacing to 1rem (16px).
2. Horizontal Gutter Class: The second row uses the `.gx-4` class to set horizontal gutter spacing to 1.5rem (24px).
3. Vertical Gutter Class: The third row uses the `.gy-5` class to set vertical gutter spacing to 3rem (48px).
