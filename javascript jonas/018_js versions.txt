✅ JavaScript (officially ECMAScript) has gone through several versions since its creation in 1995.
✅ Here's an overview of the major releases:

ECMAScript (ES) Versions 🛩️🛩️

3. ES3 (1999) - Added regular expressions, try/catch, and other features
4. ES4 (Abandoned) - Never released due to disagreements
5. ES5 (2009) - Major update adding strict mode, JSON support, array methods
6. ES6 / ES2015 - The most significant update with:
   - Classes
   - Modules
   - Arrow functions
   - Promises
   - let/const
   - Template literals
   - Destructuring
   - And many more features

Yearly Release Cycle (ES2016+) 🛩️🛩️

✅ Starting with ES2016, ECMAScript adopted a yearly release cycle:

- ES2016 (ES7): Added `Array.prototype.includes` and exponentiation operator (``)
- ES2017 (ES8): Async/await, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`, string padding
- ES2018 (ES9): Rest/spread properties, asynchronous iteration, `Promise.prototype.finally`
- ES2019 (ES10): `Array.flat()`, `Array.flatMap()`, `Object.fromEntries()`, optional catch binding
- ES2020 (ES11): BigInt, dynamic imports, nullish coalescing (`??`), optional chaining (`?.`)
- ES2021 (ES12): Logical assignment operators (`||=`, `&&=`), `String.prototype.replaceAll()`, numeric separators (`1_000`)
- ES2022 (ES13): Class fields, private methods/accessors, top-level `await`, `.at()` method for arrays/strings
- ES2023 (ES14): Array find from last, Hashbang grammar, symbols as WeakMap keys
- ES2024 (ES15): Currently in proposal stage (expected features include array grouping, `ArrayBuffer.prototype.transfer`, and more)

Browser/Engine Support 🛩️🛩️
✅ Modern JavaScript engines (V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, JavaScriptCore in Safari)
typically implement new features quickly after they're standardized.
✅ Tools like Babel are often used to transpile newer syntax to work in older browsers.

Current State 🛩️🛩️
✅ JavaScript continues to evolve with new proposals going through the TC39 process
(Stage 0-4 before becoming part of the standard).
✅ The yearly release cycle ensures a steady stream of improvements while maintaining stability.
