Switch Statement in JavaScript 🛩️🛩️

✅ The `switch` statement in JavaScript is a control structure that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions. It's an alternative to using multiple `if...else if` statements when you need to compare a single value against multiple possible cases.

✅ Basic Syntax

🚩🚩🚩🚩
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to execute if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to execute if expression === value2
    break;
  // more cases...
  default:
    // code to execute if none of the cases match
}
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ How It Works
1. The `expression` is evaluated once
2. The value of the expression is compared with each `case` value
3. When a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed
4. The `break` statement exits the switch block (without it, execution would "fall through" to the next case)
5. The `default` case is optional and runs if no matches are found

✅ Example
🚩🚩🚩🚩
let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = 'Monday';
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = 'Tuesday';
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = 'Wednesday';
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = 'Thursday';
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = 'Friday';
    break;
  case 6:
    dayName = 'Saturday';
    break;
  case 7:
    dayName = 'Sunday';
    break;
  default:
    dayName = 'Invalid day';
}

console.log(dayName); // Output: "Wednesday"

✅ Key Points
- Uses strict comparison (`===`) to match cases
- The `break` statement is crucial to prevent "fall-through" to the next case
- Multiple cases can share the same code block
- The `default` case is optional but good practice
- Can be more readable than long `if...else if` chains for multiple conditions

Fall-Through Example 🛩️🛩️
✅ Sometimes you might want multiple cases to execute the same code:

🚩🚩🚩🚩
let grade = 'B';
let result;

switch (grade) {
  case 'A':
  case 'B':
    result = 'Well done!';
    break;
  case 'C':
    result = 'Good effort';
    break;
  case 'D':
    result = 'Needs improvement';
    break;
  default:
    result = 'Invalid grade';
}

console.log(result); // Output: "Well done!"
⚡⚡⚡⚡

✅ In this example, both 'A' and 'B' grades will result in "Well done!" because the first case falls through to the second.
