Introduction to JavaScript (JS)üõ©Ô∏èüõ©Ô∏è

‚úÖ JavaScript is a versatile programming language that powers the interactive elements of modern websites. Here's a basic introduction:

‚úÖ What is JavaScript?
- A high-level, interpreted programming language
- One of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (alongside HTML and CSS)
- Enables dynamic content, interactivity, and complex web applications
- Standardized as ECMAScript (ES6/ES2015 is a major modern version)

‚úÖ Key Characteristics
- Client-side execution: Runs in the user's browser
- Multi-paradigm: Supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming
- Dynamic typing: Variables don't need type declarations
- Prototype-based: Uses prototypes instead of classes for inheritance (though ES6 added class syntax)

‚úÖ Where JavaScript Runs
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Server-side (Node.js)
- Mobile apps (React Native, Ionic)
- Desktop apps (Electron)
- Databases (MongoDB)
- IoT devices

‚úÖ JavaScript has evolved significantly since its creation in 1995 and is now one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
