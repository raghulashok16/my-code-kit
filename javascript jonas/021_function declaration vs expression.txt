✅ In JavaScript, functions can be defined in two main ways: function declarations and function expressions.
✅ Here are the key differences between them:

1. Function Declaration 🛩️🛩️
- Defined using the `function` keyword followed by a name.
- Hoisted: Can be called before its definition in the code.
- Has its own scope (`this`, `arguments`, `super`, `new.target`).


Syntax: 🛩️🛩️
🚩🚩🚩🚩
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
⚡⚡⚡⚡

Example: 🛩️🛩️
🚩🚩🚩🚩
greet(); // Works due to hoisting

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
⚡⚡⚡⚡

2. Function Expression 🛩️🛩️
- Defined by assigning a function to a variable.
- Not hoisted: Cannot be called before its definition.
- Can be anonymous (unnamed) or named.
- Often used in callbacks, IIFEs, and closures.

Syntax: 🛩️🛩️
🚩🚩🚩🚩
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
⚡⚡⚡⚡

Example: 🛩️🛩️
🚩🚩🚩🚩
greet(); // Error: greet is not defined yet (no hoisting)

const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
⚡⚡⚡⚡

Key Differences: 🛩️🛩️
| Feature               | Function Declaration | Function Expression    |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------  |
| Hoisting              | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No                 | 
| Name (identity)       | Has a name           | Can be anonymous       |
| Usage                 | General functions    | Callbacks, closures    |
| Assignment            | Not required         | Assigned to a variable |

✅ When to Use Which?
- Use Function Declarations when you need hoisting or a standalone function.
- Use Function Expressions when you need to pass a function as an argument (callback) or assign it dynamically.

Arrow Functions (Special Case of Function Expression) 🛩️🛩️
🚩🚩🚩🚩
const greet = () => console.log("Hello!");
⚡⚡⚡⚡

Summary: 🛩️🛩️
- Function Declarations are hoisted and have a name.
- Function Expressions are not hoisted and can be anonymous.
- Arrow Functions are a concise form of function expressions (but without their own `this` binding).
