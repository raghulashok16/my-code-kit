The display: none and visibility: hidden properties in CSS are used to control the visibility of elements, but they function in different ways.

# ------------------------------- display: none ------------------------------ #
1. Effect: Completely removes the element from the document flow. The element does not take up any space, and it is as if it does not exist in the DOM.
2. Use Case: Useful for hiding elements that should not affect the layout or be accessible (e.g., hiding a modal dialog).
CSS
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
.hidden {
    display: none;
}

# --------------------------------- Example: --------------------------------- #
HTML:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        .hidden {
            display: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div>This div is visible.</div>
    <div class="hidden">This div is hidden and does not take up space.</div>
    <div>This div is also visible.</div>
</body>
</html>
//////////////////////////////////////////////

# ---------------------------- visibility: hidden ---------------------------- #
1. Effect: Hides the element but it still takes up space in the document layout. The element is invisible, but its allocated space remains.
2. Use Case: Useful when you want to hide elements without collapsing the layout (e.g., hiding a tooltip).
CSS
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
.invisible {
    visibility: hidden;
}
//////////////////////////////////////////////

# --------------------------------- Example: --------------------------------- #
HTML:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        .invisible {
            visibility: hidden;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div>This div is visible.</div>
    <div class="invisible">This div is hidden but still takes up space.</div>
    <div>This div is also visible.</div>
</body>
</html>

# -------------------------------- Comparison -------------------------------- #
                 display: none;                                   visibility: hidden;
Visibility	    -Element is not visible	                        - Element is not visible
Space in Layout	-Element does not take up any space	            - Element still takes up space
Accessibility	-Element is not accessible by screen readers	- Element may still be accessible by screen readers
Re-rendering	-Causes reflow and repaint when toggled	        - Only causes repaint when toggled

# ---------------------------------- Summary --------------------------------- #
1. Use display: none when you want to completely remove an element from the layout and the document flow.
1. Use visibility: hidden when you want to hide an element but retain its space in the layout, preserving the overall structure.


Understanding the difference between these properties helps in making better decisions for layout and element visibility management in web development.
