Cascading in CSS refers to the way CSS rules are applied to HTML elements based on their order of precedence. The term "cascading" originates from the fact that multiple styles can apply to the same element, and these styles "cascade" down in a specific order to determine the final style applied.

# ------------------------- Key Concepts of Cascading ------------------------ #
1. Source Order: If two rules have the same specificity, the one that comes later in the CSS file will take precedence. This is known as the "last rule wins" principle.

2. Specificity: CSS uses a specificity hierarchy to determine which rules are most specific. Specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used:

- Inline styles have the highest specificity.
- IDs are more specific than classes, which are more specific than element selectors.
- The more specific a rule, the higher its priority.

3. Importance: The !important declaration can be used to override any other rules, regardless of specificity or source order. However, its use should be limited as it can make the CSS harder to maintain.

4. Inheritance: Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements. For example, font-family and color are inherited, while others like width and margin are not.


# ---------------------------------- Example --------------------------------- #
Here is an example to illustrate how cascading works:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        /* Element selector - lowest specificity */
        p {
            color: blue;
        }

        /* Class selector - higher specificity than element */
        .important {
            color: red;
        }

        /* ID selector - higher specificity than class */
        #unique {
            color: green;
        }

        /* Inline style - highest specificity */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This paragraph will be blue.</p>
    <p class="important">This paragraph will be red.</p>
    <p id="unique">This paragraph will be green.</p>
    <p style="color: purple;">This paragraph will be purple.</p>
</body>
</html>

# -------------------------------- Explanation ------------------------------- #
1. The first paragraph (<p>) will be blue because it is styled by the element selector p.
2. The second paragraph (<p class="important">) will be red because the class selector .important has higher specificity than the element selector.
3. The third paragraph (<p id="unique">) will be green because the ID selector #unique has higher specificity than both the class selector and the element selector.
4. The fourth paragraph (<p style="color: purple;">) will be purple because the inline style has the highest specificity of all.

# ---------------------------------- Summary --------------------------------- #
1. The cascading order in CSS ensures that styles are applied in a predictable way.
2. Understanding how specificity, source order, importance, and inheritance work together helps in writing effective and maintainable CSS.
