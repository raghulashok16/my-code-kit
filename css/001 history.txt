CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) has a rich history dating back to the early days of the web. Here is a brief overview of its evolution:

✅ 1. Early 1990s: As the World Wide Web started to gain popularity, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was used to structure content. However, HTML lacked the ability to control the presentation and layout of web pages.

✅ 2. 1994: Håkon Wium Lie proposed the concept of CSS while working at CERN, the same organization where the web was born. His idea was to separate content from presentation, allowing for more flexible and consistent web design.

✅ 3. 1996: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published the first official CSS specification, CSS1. This version introduced basic styling features such as fonts, colors, and spacing.

✅ 4. 1998: CSS2 was released, expanding on CSS1 with additional capabilities, including absolute and relative positioning, z-index, and media types. This version greatly enhanced the ability to create more complex layouts.

✅ 5. 2000s: With the rise of more advanced web browsers, CSS adoption increased significantly. Developers started to leverage CSS for more sophisticated designs and responsive layouts.

✅ 6. 2011: CSS3 was introduced as a modularized version of CSS, with each module representing a different aspect of the language (e.g., Selectors, Box Model, Backgrounds and Borders, Animations). CSS3 brought significant enhancements, including transitions, transformations, animations, and flexible box layouts (Flexbox).

✅ 7. 2017: CSS Grid Layout, a powerful two-dimensional layout system, was introduced, providing more control over complex web layouts.

✅ . Present: CSS continues to evolve with new features and improvements. It remains a fundamental technology for web development, enabling developers to create visually appealing and responsive websites.

CSS has come a long way from its inception, transforming the way web content is presented and making the web a more visually rich and interactive space.
