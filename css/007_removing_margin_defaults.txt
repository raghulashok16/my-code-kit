Include the CSS rules at the beginning of your main CSS file or in the <head> section of your HTML document before your custom styles. This ensures that the reset styles are applied first, and your styles will override them as needed.

Example:
1. Hereâ€™s how you might include a universal reset in an HTML document.

HTML:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Default Margin Reset</title>
    <style>
        /* Universal reset to remove default margin */
        * {
            margin: 0;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph with no default margin.</p>
</body>
</html>

These methods help ensure that your web page looks consistent across different browsers by removing default margins.
