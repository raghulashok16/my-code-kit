In HTML, elements are categorized into two main types based on their display behavior: block-level elements and inline elements. Understanding the difference between these two types is essential for controlling the layout and structure of web pages.

# --------------------------- Block-Level Elements --------------------------- #
1. Characteristics:
- Start on a new line.
- Take up the full width available (unless a specific width is set).
- Can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.
- The height and width can be controlled.

2. Common Block-Level Elements:
<div>
<p>
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
<ul>, <ol>, <li>
<header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>

# --------------------------------- Example: --------------------------------- #
HTML:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Block Elements Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div style="background-color: lightblue;">
            <h1>Heading 1</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph inside a block-level div element.</p>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>

# ------------------------------ Inline Elements ----------------------------- #
1. Characteristics:
- Do not start on a new line; they appear on the same line as adjacent elements.
- Take up only as much width as necessary.
- Cannot contain block-level elements, but can contain other inline elements.
- The height and width cannot be controlled (they are determined by the content).

2. Common Inline Elements:
<span>
<a>
<img>
<strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>
<input>, <label>

# --------------------------------- Example: --------------------------------- #
HTML:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Inline Elements Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a paragraph with <span style="color: red;">an inline span element</span> inside it.</p>
        <a href="#">This is an inline anchor element</a>
    </body>
    </html>

# -------------------------------- Comparison -------------------------------- #
            Block                                               Inline
Line Break	Start on a new line	                                Do not start on a new line
Width	    Take up the full width available by default	        Take up only as much width as necessary
Height	    Can be controlled	                                Determined by the content
Containment	Can contain both block-level and inline elements	Can contain other inline elements only
# ---------------------------------- Summary --------------------------------- #
1. Block-Level Elements: Useful for creating larger, container-like structures. They start on a new line and take up the full width available.
2. Inline Elements: Useful for styling small parts of text or embedding small elements within text. They do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as needed.


Understanding the differences between block-level and inline elements helps in designing and organizing the layout of web pages effectively.
