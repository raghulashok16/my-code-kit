Inheritance in CSS refers to the mechanism by which certain properties applied to a parent element are passed down, or inherited, by its child elements. This allows for consistent styling across a webpage without the need to repeatedly specify the same styles for each element.

# ----------------------- Key Points About Inheritance ----------------------- #
1. Inherited Properties: Not all CSS properties are inheritable. Common inheritable properties include:
- color
- font-family
- font-size
- line-height
- visibility

2. Non-Inherited Properties: Properties that do not inherit by default typically include:
- margin
- padding
- border
- background
- width
- height

3. The inherit Keyword:
You can explicitly set a property to be inherited using the inherit keyword, even if it is not inheritable by default.

Example: border: inherit;

# ---------------------------------- Example --------------------------------- #
Consider the following example to illustrate inheritance:

HTML
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <style>
        /* Parent element styles */
        .parent {
            color: blue; /* This property will be inherited */
            font-size: 20px; /* This property will be inherited */
            margin: 20px; /* This property will NOT be inherited */
        }

        /* Child element styles */
        .child {
            font-size: inherit; /* Explicitly inherit font-size */
            padding: 10px; /* This property will NOT be inherited */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="parent">
        Parent Element
        <div class="child">
            Child Element
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>

Explanation:
1. Inherited Properties:
- The color property set on the .parent class will be inherited by the .child class, so the text inside both the parent and child elements will be blue.
- The font-size property set on the .parent class will be inherited by the .child class because we explicitly set font-size: inherit; in the .child class.

2. Non-Inherited Properties:
- The margin property set on the .parent class will not be inherited by the .child class. Each element will have its own margin.
- The padding property set on the .child class is specific to the child element and will not be influenced by the parent element.

# ---------------------------------- Summary --------------------------------- #
1. Inheritance in CSS allows for efficient and consistent styling by passing down certain properties from parent elements to their children.
2.  While not all properties are inheritable, the inherit keyword can be used to explicitly inherit properties when needed.
3. Understanding inheritance helps in creating more maintainable and organized CSS.
