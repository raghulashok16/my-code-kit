Complete Redux Roadmap: Beginner to Expert  

This is a detailed roadmap to learn Redux, covering concepts from beginner to expert level.



# --------------------- ðŸ”° Beginner Level (Fundamentals) --------------------- #

1. Introduction to Redux  
- What is Redux?  
- Why use Redux? (State Management in Large Apps)  
- Problems Redux Solves  
- Understanding Unidirectional Data Flow  

2. Setting Up Redux in a Project  
- Installing Redux (`npm install redux react-redux`)  
- Creating a Simple Redux Store  
- Understanding Actions, Reducers, and Store  

3. Core Redux Concepts  
- Store (Global State Container)  
- Actions (Describing Changes in State)  
- Reducers (Pure Functions Updating State)  
- Dispatch (Triggering Actions)  
- Selectors (Retrieving Specific Parts of State)  

4. Connecting Redux to React (Using React-Redux)  
- Using `Provider` to Wrap the App  
- Connecting Components with `useSelector` (Reading State)  
- Dispatching Actions with `useDispatch`  
- Mapping State & Actions to Props (`connect` HOC)  



# -------------- ðŸš€ Intermediate Level (Advanced Redux Concepts) ------------- #

5. Middleware in Redux  
- What is Middleware?  
- Using Built-in Middleware (`redux-thunk`, `redux-saga`)  
- Creating Custom Middleware  

6. Asynchronous Actions in Redux  
- Handling API Calls in Redux  
- Using Redux Thunk for Async Actions  
- Using Redux Toolkitâ€™s `createAsyncThunk`  

7. Redux DevTools  
- Setting Up Redux DevTools  
- Debugging Redux State Changes  

8. Redux Toolkit (RTK) - Modern Redux Approach  
- Why Use Redux Toolkit?  
- Installing Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`)  
- Creating Slices (`createSlice`)  
- Using `configureStore` to Simplify Store Setup  
- Async Handling with `createAsyncThunk`  
- Using RTK Query for Data Fetching  

9. State Normalization & Best Practices  
- Structuring Redux State  
- Normalizing Data for Efficiency  
- Using `reselect` for Memoized Selectors  



# ---------------- ðŸ’Ž Expert Level (Performance & Scalability) --------------- #

10. Performance Optimization in Redux  
- Avoiding Unnecessary Re-renders  
- Optimizing Selectors with `reselect`  
- Using Immutable State Properly  
- Lazy Loading Reducers (`injectReducer`)  

11. Advanced Redux Patterns  
- Feature-Based State Management  
- Redux Ducks Pattern  
- Module-Based Structure  
- Event Sourcing with Redux  

12. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Redux  
- Using Redux with Next.js  
- Hydrating State on the Server  
- Persisting State with `redux-persist`  

13. Redux Alternatives & Comparison  
- Redux vs Context API  
- Redux vs Zustand  
- When to Use Redux vs Other State Management Solutions  



# ---------------- ðŸŒŸ Final Step: Building Real-World Projects --------------- #

Here are some project ideas to practice Redux skills:  
1. E-Commerce App (State for Cart, Products, Orders)  
2. Chat Application (Handling Real-time Messages with Redux)  
3. Task Manager App (Redux Toolkit + Async API Calls)  
4. Finance Dashboard (Using Redux for Managing Complex Data)
